# What is Python? #
Python is an *object-oriented language* and is known for it's code *readability*. Now, what does all of this mean? 

Object-oriented programming basically means that Python puts things into individual boxes. Each boz has a label that 
encompasses the contents. This basically means that a certain object (box) has it's own properties (contents) which you can 
reuse throughout your program.

Python is a popular language primarily because of it's code readability. Code readability beasically means how easy is it 
to understand the code without prior knowledge of the language. If the language has good code readability, it signifies that 
the structure of the code is similar to English.

## Basic Principles ##

### Class ###
A class is a template that describes what a certain object will look like. You can think of it as a shelve of boxes, where 
each box has it's own place and is labeled with all of it's details. 

In order to define a class, you would have to use the __class__ keyword.

```python
class dog:
  pass
```
